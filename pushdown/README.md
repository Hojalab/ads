# Flash Pushdowns

## Creation

The simplest way to create a flash pushdown is with the `pushdown.fla` found in the `fla` directory above.  Go to that directory for more information.

## swf_parent

On iheart.com, all pushdowns are children of this main swf. `swf_parent` is responsible for loading all pushdowns, tracking user actions, and dispatching events back to the loaded pushdown. For more information, click into the `swf_parent` directory.

## Testing

Check out the `test` directory above.
